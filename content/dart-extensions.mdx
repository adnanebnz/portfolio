Dart extensions allow you to add functionality to existing libraries and classes without modifying them. Extensions are a powerful feature, especially when you want to add methods to types you don't own. With extensions, you can create custom methods that feel like they're part of the original type.

Example: Logging Object Values with devtools.log
In this example, weâ€™ll create an extension on the Object class to log any objectâ€™s value using the devtools.log method. This can be especially useful for debugging.

let's create the extension:

```dart
import 'package:devtools/devtools.dart' as devtools;

extension Log on Object {
void log() => devtools.log(toString());
}
```

Now you can call **log()** on any object to log its value:

```dart
void main() {
String greeting = "Hello World";
greeting.log(); // Logs: "Hello World"


int number = 42;
number.log(); // Logs: "42"
}
```

This extension leverages Dart's powerful extension methods to make logging more convenient and less intrusive in your codebase.

This would make a good addition to your blog post and help readers understand how to create and use Dart extensions effectively.
